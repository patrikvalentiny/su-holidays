            </p>
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">How it works</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4 space-y-1">

              <li>Provide your company's information and CVR number.</li>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">How to apply for SU holidays?</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              If you have failed to work the required number of hours per month, you can use <strong>SU holiday</strong>. SU gives you the option to have <strong>6 weeks</strong> when the state does not check your working hours. However, before you can apply for a holiday you need to work for at least <strong>3 months in a row</strong>.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              When that condition is met, you can divide these 6 weeks to your liking. You can also submit the SU holiday <strong>retrospectively</strong> for past periods, up to a few months prior.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">How to submit the form</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Once you have generated and downloaded the PDF form using this tool, have your employer sign and stamp it. After the form is finalised, you must upload it through <a href="https://www.su.dk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-primary hover:underline">SU.dk</a> and fill out the period you are taking your holiday.
